# TypeScript Design Patterns

Popular design patterns implemented in TypeScript.

## Designs

- [Decorator](###-Decorator)
- [Observer](###-Observer)
- [Facade](###-Facade)

### Decorator

Often used for adding additional functionality to another class by wrapping it. This allows developers to add/extend functionality without impacting other objects using the same class.

_My Take_: I don't use this pattern often but it is a powerful pattern for specific use cases. Main reason I don't use this pattern much is because I feel if used a lot, it can end up making the code more difficult to understand/maintain.
